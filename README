                             DBD::Ovrimos

                      A DBD driver for Ovrimos
                      -----------------------

                           Release 0.12
                           ------------

 To install, execute the following commands:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

 This will take care of installing the driver at the correct place in the
 perl directory tree.

 The driver is a single perl module; there is no XS, no compilation involved,
 so there is nothing that can go wrong with the installation. After completing
 the installation, you should read the POD (run 'perldoc DBD::Ovrimos') to
 familiarize yourself with the peculiarities of this driver. A good working
 knowledge of DBI is indispensable, because no tutorial or other help is
 included. Visit the DBI homepage at 
       http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/index.html 
 to find out more.

 This is the fourth release of the driver. It could misbehave in various ways.
 (That's why it's not 1.00; because it may lack a final touch).
 The main difference from the first release, is that it now contains the
 functionality needed to write stored procedures for Ovrimos using the AGI 
 protocol.
